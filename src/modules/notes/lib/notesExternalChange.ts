/**
 * Decide how an open note should react when the notes folder reports a
 * filesystem change. Kept pure so the policy is unit-testable without the
 * watcher or the editor.
 *
 * - `ignore`: the change does not touch this note, or it is the echo of our
 *   own recent debounced write.
 * - `reload`: the file changed on disk and there are no unsaved local edits, so
 *   we can safely show the disk version.
 * - `prompt`: the file changed on disk but there are unsaved local edits, so the
 *   user must choose between the disk version and their own.
